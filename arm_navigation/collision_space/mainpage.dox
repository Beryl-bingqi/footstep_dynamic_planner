@section summary Summary 

\b collision_space is used to represent collisions between a given
robot model (as in <a href="../../planning_models/html">planning_models</a>) and the
environment. Self collision checking is performed and contact
positions and normals can be computed.


An abstract interface (collision_space::EnvironmentModel) is provided
to a set of collision checking libraries.
